How we made it in Africa first interviewed Michael Wilkerson, founder of Tugende, in 2015. Tugende provides financing to motorcycle taxis drivers – known as boda-bodas – in Uganda through a lease-to-own agreement. Boda-bodas typically don’t own their motorcycles; they use a large portion of their earnings to rent them from a ‘landlord’, never quite managing to save enough to buy their own. Tugende’s model is simple: responsible drivers are identified who pay Tugende typically 15% more a week than they would if they were renting the motorbike. Within 24 months or less – most clients finish ahead of schedule – they become owners. The company finances those deemed too risky by traditional lenders, such as banks. Sven Hugo talks to Wilkerson to learn more about the company’s revenue model, the challenges it faces and expansion plans on the horizon. Thank you for reading How we made it in Africa.
